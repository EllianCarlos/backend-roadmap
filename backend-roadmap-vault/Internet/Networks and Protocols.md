Networks are the construct we use to connect and pass information between computers. Computers connect themselves via any viable method of eletronic comunication, e.g. CAT Cables, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth. 

Any physical method can form a valid connection to a network, but the main comunication protocols are Wi-Fi, Wireless Mobile (3G/4G/5G) and Cable Connection. Physical connections are only the first layer of comunication within a network, from this type of connection we build abstractions upon abstractions, so there are models to separate abstractions into layers.

OSI Model

The OSI model separate all comunication between computers and protocols into 7 layers. The OSI model can be used to understand all network comunication regardless of the implementation as its a very basic yet complete overview of the main parts of networks and its protocols.

Because of this the OSI Model is a reference/logical model, not a used model for real applications. But all main other derive from this.
